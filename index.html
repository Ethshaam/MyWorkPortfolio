        <h2 >Who Am I</h2>
        <p>
        Hello, thank you for visiting my website. I am a graduate of Birmingham City University specializing in the field of Digital Media Technology. Over the course of my studies and projects I have gained many valuable skills which I now can offer to you and your business
        
        
        <h3> University projects</h3>
        <p>Throughout my time at university, we worked on numerous projects. Several of which were based around web development and getting used to the scripting side as well as the back end of web development 
        <br>
             The projects which we worked on were:
        <br>
             Building a website using bootstrap and JS and making sure the website fits the purpose of the design sheet that we had and is responsive
        <br>
             Collaborating with a team to ensure that a client gets its website, working with mockups, also having to deliver a presentation to the client.
        <br>
            Creating a Jukebox, with MYSQL, and PHP. Fetching data from a database in Localhost and echoing out on a website. Whilst also ensuring that the website is responsive and adding in features to make it interactive. Features such as Modals were used with Javascript.
            <br> 
                Lastly we worked on the usage of Application Programme Interfaces <span id="API"> API </span>.
                <br>
                With this, I had to use backend languages such as Angular, and React to make the website accessible, user-friendly, and inclusive. 
        </p>
        <h3> Personal Projects</h3>
        <p>I have done some of my work, in my own time. Projects I worked on include, building an advanced version of TicTacToe in python. Making a scene in Blender, using some of the transferable skills I have learned when I was learning Maya for University. Additionally, I have also coded an automation test with Selenium with Java.</p>

                            <p>In the first two weeks of the get into tech programme with amazon web servers. We learned about mindsets, Growth, persistance and blame mindset, to see how they can come into play in the world of work. 
                              
                               we learned some commands in the linux terminal. The commands we learned where:
                                <p>Cut, sed, Crontab, Cat, touch, if statements, for loops, while loops, vi/vim, functions, Chmod and Chown</p>
                                
                              <p> To maintain familarity with the terminal we were instructed to create a basic game using if statements and for/while loops. The game was a user inputted one. So the user would have to type in './cheese.sh' to activate the game. Then an prompt would appear (as the video shows) </p>

                            <p>Throughout my second year of university, I was given creative freedom whilst undertaking a 3d modeling and animation module at university. Being a fan of science fiction, I decided to model the TARDIS, as it was something I knew I would give it the full attention of detail it needed. As you can see in the video below, the TARDIS console is very intricate in terms of the details that it has. The TARDIS also has some of the characteristics in which the Doctor holds. I made this using the 3d software called MAYA.

                              <p>Highly available meaning it's accessible when you need it. It's an on-demand service</p>
                              <p> Fault tolerance meaning it can withstand a certain amount of failure and remain functional. AWS uses Load balancers to enable this. A load balancer is when the program diverts traffic to another port so one port doesn't become too congested with information</p>
                              <p> Scalabity = ability to grow in size when required, meaning you make more servers if the demand requires it</p>

I created functionality that includes; <b>Changing the colour of text and changing the background</b> I also enhanced the user experience by allowing the user to drag the note canvas around the scene. You could also be able to spawn new notes in, which meant if you can create multiple

                              <p> <i> Amazon Block Storage (ABS)</i> is a storage system which AWS provides. ABS comes added onto your EC2 instance. There are many different storage types you can have within AWS they are; <i>ABS, EBS (elastic block storage) </i> but this service can only be mounted if the ec2 instance has been launched within the same Availability zone. <i> An availability zone is a logical data center in a region. The main difference between S3 and EBS is that S3 is a persistant storage device and can be accessed from anywhere unlike EBS.  </i></p>
                              
                                <p>EBS is an block storage system that is best used for storing persistant data. As mentioned earlier it is a highly available storage for use with an ec2 AMI</p>
                              <p>What is Persistant Storag? <br> Persistant storage is any data storage that retains data after the power to the device is off. Can also be referred to as <i>Non volatile Storage</i><br>Each EBS volume is automatically replicated to protect the user from component failure which offers the user high availability and durability. EBS is also consistent and runs low-latency performans<br> The user also has the ability to scale up and down within minutes,

                                  <b>Block Storage vs Object Storage</b>
                                  Block Storage you change only the block which contains the character. Object Storage is you have to change to whole file which requires updating. The difference has a major impact on the throughput, latency and cost of the storage solution

                        <p> Amazon EC2 stands for: <i> Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud</i>. EC2 is a web service which is provided by Amazon Web Services it is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. EC2s interface allows the user to obtain and configure capacity with minimum friction which means it isn't very hard to do. It provides the user with free range control over the computing resources which Amazon Provides you with. </p>
                        <p> EC2 allows you to build an instance within the AWS environment. An instance is a Virtual Machine which gives you free range of different operation systems from Mac OS, Windows OS and Linux OS. It does this by giving the user a choice of: <i>Processor, Storage, Networking, Operating System and purchase Model. </i></p>
                              
                                
                              <p><i> Functionality of EC2</i></p>       
                              <p> EC2 allows you to choose a pre-configured, AMI <i> Amazon Machine Image </i> to get you up and running immediately. Or you can create an AMI which contains the applications, library, data and configured settings</p>
                              <p> Configure the networking and security of your instance</p>
                              <p> Choose which instance type you would like to work on, with this you are also able to terminate, monitor and start as many instances as you would like</p>
                              <p>You have free range as to where you can set up your instance wether that be in England or in the United States </p>
                              <p> Pay only for what you use such as the data that the instance consumes. <i>This is normally on an hourly basis</i></p>
                              <br>
                            <h4>How would you use EC2?</h4>   
                              <br>
                              <p>As mentioned above EC2 is primarly used to create new instances (VMs) and to do this you would need to:</p>
                              <ol>
                              <li>Go to the amazon web management console and go to services and click EC2</li>
                                <li>An AMI is an Image which is required to launch an Instance. </li>
                                <li>Then configure the Operation system or an application server with applications</li>
                                  <li> <i> Note: Each instance type has its uses. The user is able to choose: CPU, MEMORY, STORAGE and Networking capacity and gives you the flexibility to choose the mix that is required</i></li>
                                  <li><i>Configuring instance details</i>
                                       
                                      <p> The Instance details are things what network you would like to have as you are able to have ones for different use cases. You are able to have ones for: <i>Development, Testing and production</i></p>
                                      <p>Here you can also safe guard yourself from accidental termination. When instance in terminated the resources are released, which means it cannot be re-started. </p>
                                    
                                  </li>
                            <li><p><i> Add Storage </i> <br> The storage which the instance has is from a virtual disk known as <i> Amazon Block Storage, here you are able to tell the instance how much memory you want it to have</i></p></li>
                                  <li><p> Add Tags <br> The tags in the instance gives it identification and recognition. It has 2 key pairs (Simialr to a dictionairy in other coding languages)</p></li>
                                  <li><p>Configure security Group <br> A security group acts as a firewall that controls traffic for one or more instances. <i> NOTE: A firewall only monitors traffic coming into the instance</i> The security group will then have a group name and a description</p></li>
                                  <li><p><i>Review and Launch Instance</i> You can know launch the instance</p></li>
